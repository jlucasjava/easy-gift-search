URGENT VERCEL SYNC FIX - June 2, 2025 07:40 UTC

CRITICAL ISSUE: Vercel is deploying old commit 22d0530 instead of latest commit 462814a

PROBLEM:
- Vercel build log shows: "Cloning github.com/jlucasjava/easy-gift (Branch: production, Commit: 22d0530)"
- Error: "No Output Directory named 'public' found"
- This commit is very old and doesn't have the public/ directory

SOLUTION NEEDED:
- Force Vercel to use latest commit 462814a
- This commit has the complete public/ directory structure
- Footer implementation is complete in this commit

DEPLOYMENT STATUS: BLOCKED - Vercel cache/reference issue
URGENT: Need to clear Vercel deployment cache
